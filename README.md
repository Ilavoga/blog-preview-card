## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

The project helped me practice and reinforce several key frontend skills. Here are some of the major 
skills I learned:

-How to use Flexbox to center elements both vertically and horizontally

```
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
}
```
-How to use @font-face to import a custom font locally from the assets folder:

```
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Figtree';
  src: url('./assets/fonts/Figtree-VariableFont_wght.ttf') format('truetype');
}
```
